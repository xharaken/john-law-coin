# [Overview]
#
# JohnLawCoin is a stable coin realized by an Algorithmic Central Bank (ACB).
# The system is fully decentralized and there is truly no gatekeeper.
#
# JohnLawCoin is a real-world experiment to verify the following assumption:
#
# - It is possible to stabilize the coin price with fully algorithmically
#   defined monetary policies without holding any collateral.
#
# If JohnLawCoin is successful and proves the assumption is correct, it will
# provide interesting insights for both non-fiat currencies and fiat
# currencies; i.e., 1) there is a way for non-fiat cryptocurrencies to
# stabilize their currency price without having any gatekeeper, and 2) there
# is a way for central banks of developing countries to implement a fixed
# exchange rate system without holding adequate USD reserves. This will
# upgrade human's understanding about money.
#
# JohnLawCoin has the following important properties:
#
# - There is truly no gatekeeper. The ACB is fully automated and no one
#   (including the author of the smart contract) has the privileges of
#   influencing the monetary policies of the ACB. This can be verified by the
#   fact that the smart contract has no operations that need privileged
#   permissions.
# - The smart contract is self-contained. There are no dependencies on other
#   smart contracts and external services.
# - All operations are guaranteed to terminate in the time complexity of O(1).
#   The time complexity of each operation is determined solely by the input
#   size of the operation and not affected by the state of the smart contract.
#

# exchange rate to 1.0 as follows:

# 1. The ACB obtains the exchange rate from the oracle.

# 3. If the exchange rate is larger than 1.0, the ACB increases the total coin

#    and provides the coins to the oracle as the reward.
