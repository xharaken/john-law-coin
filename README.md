# What is JohnLawCoin?

*JohnLawCoin* is a stablecoin realized by an *Algorithmic Central Bank (ACB)*. The system is fully decentralized and there is truly no gatekeeper. No gatekeeper means there is no entity to be regulated.

JohnLawCoin is a real-world experiment to verify the following assumption: It is possible to stabilize the currency price with fully algorithmically defined monetary policies without holding any collateral.

If JohnLawCoin is successful and proves the assumption is correct, it will provide interesting insights for both non-fiat currencies and fiat currencies; i.e., 1) there is a way for non-fiat cryptocurrencies to stabilize their currency price without having any gatekeeper, and 2) there is a way for central banks of developing countries to implement a fixed exchange rate system without holding adequate USD reserves. This will upgrade human's understanding about money.
