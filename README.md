# What is JohnLawCoin?

*JohnLawCoin* is a stablecoin realized by an *Algorithmic Central Bank (ACB)*. The system is fully decentralized and there is truly no gatekeeper. No gatekeeper means there is no entity to be regulated.

JohnLawCoin is a real-world experiment to verify one assumption: *There is a way to stabilize the currency price with algorithmically defined monetary policies without holding any collateral.*

If JohnLawCoin is successful and proves the assumption is correct, it will provide interesting insights for both non-fiat currencies and fiat currencies; i.e., 1) there is a way for non-fiat cryptocurrencies to implement a stablecoin without having any gatekeeper that holds collateral, and 2) there is a way for developing countries to implement a fixed exchange rate system for their fiat currencies without holding adequate USD reserves. This will upgrade human's understanding about money.

See [the whitepaper](./docs/whitepaper.pdf) for more details. See [the smart contract](./contracts/JohnLawCoin.sol) for the implementation.
