# What is JohnLawCoin?

***This software is now under testing. The wallet is not ready to use yet.***

<img src="./docs/logo.png" width=120px>

***JohnLawCoin*** is a stablecoin realized by an ***Algorithmic Central Bank (ACB)***. The monetary policies are backed by MMT (Modern Monetary Theory). The system is fully decentralized and there is truly no gatekeeper. No gatekeeper means there is no entity to be regulated.

JohnLawCoin is a real-world experiment to verify one assumption: ***There is a way to stabilize the currency price with algorithmically defined monetary policies without holding any collateral like USD.***

If JohnLawCoin is successful and proves the assumption is correct, it will provide interesting insights for both non-fiat currencies and fiat currencies; i.e., 1) there is a way for non-fiat cryptocurrencies to implement a stablecoin without having any gatekeeper that holds collateral, and 2) there is a way for developing countries to implement a fixed exchange rate system for their fiat currencies without holding adequate USD reserves. This will upgrade human's understanding about money.

See [the whitepaper](./docs/whitepaper.pdf) for more details. See [the smart contract](https://github.com/xharaken/john-law-coin/blob/main/contracts/JohnLawCoin.sol) for the implementation.
