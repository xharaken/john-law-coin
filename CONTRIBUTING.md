# How to build

## Installation

This project uses [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) and [Openzeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/). You can install the packages as follows:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
$ sudo npm install -g truffle
$ sudo npm install  openzeppelin-solidity
$ sudo npm install @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable
$ sudo npm install -g ganache-cli
$ sudo npm init -y
```

## Directory structure

|--- contracts/    # Smart contracts.
|    |---- JohnLawCoin.sol     # A smart contract of JohnLawCoin.sol.
|    |---- JohnLawCoinTest.sol # A smart contract to test JohnLawCoin.sol.
|    |---- Migrations.sol      # A smart contract to deploy JohnLawCoin.sol.
|---- docs/        # A whitepaper and documentation.
|---- migrations/  # Migration scripts to deploy the smart contracts.
|---- test/        # Tests and simulators for JohnLawCoin.sol.
|---- python/      # Tests and simulators for the JohnLawCoin algorithm written in Python (much faster than Truffle).
|---- truffle-config.js # Truffle configuration file.
```

## Running tests

Launch a private network in one console.

```bash
$ ganache-cli -l 1200000000 -a 15
```

Run `truffle test` in another console. Or you can specify a test like `truffle test test/coin_bond_unittest.js`.

```bash
$ truffle test
```
