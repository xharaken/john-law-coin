***[Note: Currently JohnLawCoin is being tested on the Testnet. Your feedback is critical to improve the system before it's launched to the Ethereum Mainnet (planned in 2021).]***

***JohnLawCoin*** is a non-collateralized stablecoin realized by an ***Algorithmic Central Bank (ACB)***. The system is fully decentralized and there is truly no gatekeeper. No gatekeeper means there is no entity to be regulated.

JohnLawCoin is a real-world experiment to verify one assumption: ***There is a way to stabilize the currency price with algorithmically defined monetary policies without holding any collateral like USD.***

If JohnLawCoin is successful and proves the assumption is correct, it will provide interesting insights for both non-fiat cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies; i.e., 1) non-fiat cryptocurrencies can use the algorithm to implement a stablecoin without having any gatekeeper that holds collateral, and 2) real-world central banks of developing countries can use the algorithm to implement a fixed exchange rate system for their fiat currencies without holding adequate USD reserves. This will upgrade human's understanding about money.

There are a couple of preceding examples of non-collateralized stablecoins like BasisCoin and Empty Set Dollar. However, none of the coins has succeeded in stabilizing the currency price in the long run. JohnLawCoin is yet another experiment to solve the not-yet-solved problem by addressing issues of the existing stablecoins. The key difference between JohnLawCoin and the existing stablecoins is that JohnLawCoin implements an open market operation to stabilize the currency price.

See [the whitepaper](./docs/whitepaper.pdf) for more details. See [the smart contract](https://github.com/xharaken/john-law-coin/blob/main/contracts/JohnLawCoin.sol) for the implementation.
